 * sendData and throwError can be one function -> send

 ***** Refactoring ******
   ** req -2 
      *  parse could be better with array destructure
      *  rendering home should be done by a differnet function
   ** req - 6
      *  remove dublications from guestBook.js
      *  put innerHtml in a variable
