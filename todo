 ***** features *****
    *  Centred title at top
    *  A link to go back to home page
    *  Text fields to take name & a comment.
    *  Submit button, which takes the comment
    *  A list of comments by different guest until now with Date-time, Name and * *  Comment of each ordered with latest comment in reverse chronological order.

***** Refactoring ******
   * string literals should be in constants
   * read-body -> fs.writeFile args should be put in a variable
   * read-body -> use append instead of replace to inject tables
   * parse could be better with array destructure


***** suggestions *****
   * use labels when necessary (like forms) instead of headings or paragraphs
